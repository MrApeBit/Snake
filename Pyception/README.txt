1. A Segment is a coordinate pair in a grid that represents where a part of the snake is. 
The x and y values are the center of that square in the grid.
2. A Snake is a List of segments. The segment at index 0 is the head. The implementation of 
this is seen in the Python class.
3. A Direction is one of the following values: 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', None
4. A Food is the same as a segment, but a circle rather than a square.
