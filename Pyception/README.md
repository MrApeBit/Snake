## Pyception! · An Overview 
Hooray! This project was a huge success for me. It was by far my biggest project yet. 
With different menu screens, the ability to save and customize settings and data, 
and some pixelated text, this game ended up being a massive success! 

The biggest challenges by far were trying to make a working settings screen, and reading
and writing to the .ini file that stores data. It was my first time dealing with file
I/O in Python as well as .ini files in general, so getting this to work was a huge deal for
me! 

The base of the game wasn't anything much. I used an object-oriented approach to designing
this game, as well as for ease of future updates and easy debugging. If you want to learn
more about how I designed this game, I will be releasing more details soon!

## Pyception! · A Tutorial 
With that out of the way, let me show you how to play the game. If you're unfamiliar with 
the rules for snake, they are as follows:
1. You control a snake whihc moves in a certain direction that can be changed using the 
arrow keys.
2. Every time you eat food, your score goes up by 1 and the snake grows 1 unit longer.
3. If you hit a wall (any of the edges) or eat yourself (your head touches your tail), it's 
game over.

The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible while not hitting a wall or eating
yourself.
