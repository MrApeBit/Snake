## Pyception! · An Overview 
Hooray! This project was a huge success for me. It was by far my biggest project yet. 
With different menu screens, the ability to save and customize settings and data, 
and some pixelated text, this game ended up being a massive success! 

The biggest challenges by far were trying to make a working settings screen, and reading
and writing to the .ini file that stores data. It was my first time dealing with file
I/O in Python as well as .ini files in general, so getting this to work was a huge deal for
me! 

The base of the game wasn't anything much. I used an object-oriented approach to designing
this game, as well as for ease of future updates and easy debugging. If you want to learn
more about how I designed this game, I will be releasing more details soon!

With that out of the way, let me show you how to play the game. Rules
