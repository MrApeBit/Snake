# Snake Around The World
## It's Snake! In 5 different programming languages...

This personal project of mine is simple. It's the game you play when you're bored in class or when you have nothing better to do. My goal is to make the snake game in as many programming languages as possible, not only as a way to challenge myself but also to learn important concepts in every language. This repo will be updated frequently as I slowly release more versions.
