# Snake Around The World

## About This Project
This personal project of mine is simple. Snake is the game you play when you're bored in class or when you have nothing better to do. My goal is to make the snake game in as many programming languages as possible, not only as a way to challenge myself but also to learn important concepts in every language. My mission is to become proficient in at least 10 programming languages by the end of college. Part of that goal is to create something meaningful in each language that holds a lot of value both professionally and for fun. I'm including this as a project on my LinkedIn because it is a long-term goal that will continue to motivate me to learn computer science.

What inspired me to do this project started on a day of Zoom classes that I couldn't handle the boredom of anymore. Many of my school projects have forced me to do things in a very specific way, limiting my creativity and confining my logic to rigid bounds. With nothing better to do, I created a new Java project (since that was the language I was learning at the time) and started playing around with code. Eventually, I created a simple animation of a square moving across the screen. I spent an entire week turning that into a game. The rest is history from there.

Snake Around The World is my opportunity to test out things I wouldn't have a chance to. I'm able to think about lots of different solutions and approaches, use libraries that I didn't even know existed, and look at programming from a completely new perspective.

This repo will be updated as I release more versions and update old versions.
